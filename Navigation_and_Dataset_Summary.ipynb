    "\n",
    "- Type of load (e.g., active, reactive)\n",
    "- Type of renewable source (e.g., solar, wind)\n",
    "- Whether the dataset is synthetic or real\n",
    "- Presence of price/economic data\n",
    "- Time resolution or geographical coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find datasets with both solar and wind data  \n",
    "- Find datasets that are synthetic only  \n",
    "- Find datasets that include price data and wind generation  \n",
    "- Filter by specific load types like residential or industrial\n",
